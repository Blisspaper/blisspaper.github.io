A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/electrikjesus/pen/qYOrXB.

 Everyone seemed to really like the Canvas Ribbon pen, so I cleaned up and improved the code. Then I decided I liked @natewiley's  idea, so I incorporated the CodePen logo. It looked pretty awesome, so I decided to turn it into a wallpaper generator.

Click the canvas to make it fullscreen, click again to pause and generate a PNG wallpaper. If you don't like where it freezes, click again before the countdown ends. Did I mention that this works on mobile too? Oh, and be sure to allow popups; that was the only foolproof way to make this work in all browsers... and for some reason it only works in editor mode. I'm looking into it.
